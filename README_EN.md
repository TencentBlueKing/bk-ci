> **Note**: The `master` branch may be in an unstable or even broken state during development. Please use [releases](https://github.com/tencent/bk-ci/releases) instead of  `master` branch in order to get stable binaries.

a free & open source CI server, bk-ci(BlueKing Continuous Integration) helps you automate your build-test-release workflows, continuous delivery of your product faster, easier, with fewer bugs.

bk-ci removes all the tedious tasks in R&D process and enables you to focus on coding. It is often used for:

- Project compilation
- Static code analysis
- Running test cases to find bugs in time
- Deployment and release

bk-ci provides seven core services, namely Process, CodeCheck, Repository, Ticket, Environment, Store and Turbo. They can be combined in multiple ways to meet business needs in different scenarios.

- **Process**: It visualizes current R&D process of the team. One pipeline can handle compilation, testing and deployment.
- **CodeCheck**：Provide professional code-check solutions to check multiple dimensions of code issues such as defects, security vulnerabilities, code styles, etc., to promote product quality.
- **Repository**: It links current source code hosting service of the enterprise to bk-ci.
- **Ticket**: It provides the management of various kinds of tickets and certificates for services like Repository and Process.
- **Environment**: It can host the internal agents of the enterprise on bk-ci.
- **Store**: It consists of pipeline plugins and pipeline templates. Plugins are used to integrate with various third-party services of the enterprise and templates help to standardize its internal R&D process.
- **Turbo**: Based on self-developed acceleration engine, it supports acceleration in multiple scenarios such as C/C++ compilation, UE4 code compilation, and UE4 Shader compilation, making construction tasks faster
